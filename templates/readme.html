    <h1>Understanding xG (Expected Goals) in Football Predictions</h1>

    <h2>What is xG?</h2>
    <p>
      xG, or Expected Goals, is a statistical measure in football that
      represents the quality of scoring chances created by a team in a match.
      It's based on historical data of similar chances and how often they
      resulted in goals.
    </p>

    <h2>Simple explanation:</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine if every shot in football had a "difficulty rating" from 0 to 1:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>0 means it's impossible to score</li>
      <li>1 means it's a certain goal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      xG is the sum of these "difficulty ratings" for all shots a team takes in
      a match.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A penalty kick might have an xG of 0.76 (76% chance of scoring)</li>
      <li>
        A shot from the halfway line might have an xG of 0.01 (1% chance of
        scoring)
      </li>
      <li>
        A tap-in from 1 yard out might have an xG of 0.96 (96% chance of
        scoring)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If a team takes these three shots in a match, their total xG would be:<br />
      <code>0.76 + 0.01 + 0.96 = 1.73</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This means, based on their chances, they would be expected to score about
      1.73 goals on average.
    </p>

    <h2>Why use xG in predictions?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>It's more accurate than just looking at goals scored</li>
      <li>It accounts for the quality of chances, not just the quantity</li>
      <li>
        It can indicate if a team is performing better or worse than their
        actual goal tally suggests
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to use xG in our prediction model:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Look up recent xG statistics for both teams</li>
      <li>Input these values into our prediction form</li>
      <li>
        The model uses this information, along with other factors, to predict
        the match outcome
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Where to find xG data:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Websites like Understat, FBref, or WhoScored often provide xG data for
        matches
      </li>
      <li>
        You can calculate an average xG for recent matches if you don't have
        data for a specific upcoming match
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <em
        >Remember, xG is just one factor in predicting match outcomes, but it's
        a valuable one that gives insight into team performance beyond just
        goals scored.</em
